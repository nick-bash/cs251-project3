1. Explain why adding and removing liquidity to your exchange does not change the exchange rate.

Liquidity providers add and remove liquidity in amounts of both DragonToken and ETH that are equivalent,
as measured by the current exchange price. Because liquidity providers can only add or remove liquidity
in equivalent amounts, the exchange rate doesn't change.

2. Explain your scheme for rewarding liquidity providers and justify the design decisions you made. How does it satisfy requirements (2)-(4) from Section 5?

N/a. Didn't attempt.

3. Describe at least one method you used to minimize your exchange contract's gas usage. Why was this method effective?

Efficient data structures. I used a mapping from addresses to uints to represent each LP's shares, and 
an array of addresses to reference the liquidity providers. I'm not sure that it would be possible to
store the requisite data in a more efficient manner.

4. Optional Feedback:
4a. How much time did you spend on the assignment?
I lost track. At least 13-14 hours.

4b. What is one thing that would have been useful to know before starting the assignment?
Several things about debugging Solidity / JS and basic Solidity. For example, handling BigNumbers
errors between JS & Sol. Also I had no idea we needed to emit Transfer events from the token contract.
These things took a lot of time to debug. 

4c. If you could change one with about this assignment, what would you change?
There are a handful of typos and errors in the spec / starter code. For example, unclear what
exchange rate is supposed to be represented as the max / min in adding / removing liquidity (ETH or token?).
Further, the function definition for adding / removing liquidity in JS didn't have a parameter for 
min slippage.

4d. Please feel free to include any other feedback you may have below.
